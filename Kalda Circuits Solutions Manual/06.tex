\begin{solution}{normal}
The current through $V_1$ is $I_1$, so the resistance of the voltmeter is $R_v = \dfrac{V_1}{I_1} = 0.5 \, \mathrm{M\Omega}$. Thus the current through $V_2$ is $I_2 = V_2/R_v = 4\, \mathrm{\mu A}$. By Kirchoff's current junction rule, the current through the ammeter on the right is $I = I_1 - I_2 = \boxed{196 \, \mathrm{\mu A}}$.

The ammeter on the right has a large internal resistance of $R_A = \frac{V_2}{I}=10.2 \text{ k}\Omega$. If it was used to read the current, then the percent error would be $2\%$.
