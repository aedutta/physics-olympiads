\begin{solution}{normal}
The magnetic flux on the coil changes rapidly from $\Phi_1 = +NBS$ to $\Phi_2 = -NBS$. Thus, the total change in flux is given to be $\delta \Phi_e = 2NBS$. As the coil moves in a fast motion, the change in current is too small to give any difference, so $\delta I \approx 0$. By idea 41, one can write that the charge passing through the wires is $q = (\delta \Phi_e + L\delta I)/R\implies q = 2NBS/R$.
