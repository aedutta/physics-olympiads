\begin{solution}{normal}
The centre of mass of the system is initially on the pulley. In the horizontal direction, the net external force is provided by the tension forces (pulley), and it is always rightwards. (For the block to have covered an angle $\alpha$, the net horizontal force is $\vec{F_{\text{ext}}} = T(1- \cos{\alpha}) \hat{i}$ which is always in positive $\hat{i}$ direction. Hence the centre of mass moves right to the pulley throughout the motion. At the time of collision, it is thus right of the pulley, which is only possible if the \textbf{left block} reaches the pulley first.\footnote{This problem came in the Moscow physics olympics in the 1970s, and is also in the book 'Aptitude Test Problems in Physics by S.S. Krotov. It is quite a famous problem.}
