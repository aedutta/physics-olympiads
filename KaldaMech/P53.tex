\begin{solution}{hard}
Let the incoming mass flow rate be labelled $\mu_i$ and it is divided into the flow rates $\mu_1$ and $mu_2$. By the equation of continuity, we have$$\mu_i = \mu_1 + \mu_2$$By Bernoulli's law (or by idea 71 and fact 30), the velocity of both the left and the right compartment is same and equal to $v$. Now, by conservation of momentum in the horizontal direction (idea 72), we get$$\mu_i \rho (v\cos{\alpha}) = \mu_1 \rho (v) - \mu_2 \rho (v)$$which simplifies to$$\mu_i \cos{\alpha} = mu_1 - \mu_2$$From this equation and our initial equation of continuity, we have$$ \mu_1 = \mu_i \cos^{2}{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$$and$$\mu_2 = \mu_i \sin^{2}{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$$Hence,$$\frac{\mu_1}{\mu_2} = \frac{\mu_i \cos^{2}{\frac{\alpha}{2}}}{\mu_i \sin^{2}{\frac{\alpha}{2}}} = \boxed{\cot^{2}{\frac{\alpha}{2}}}$$
