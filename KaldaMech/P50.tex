\begin{solution}{normal}
We use the fact that effective gravity is given as $g_{\text{eff}} = g\cos\alpha$. This directly means that 
\[T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{R}{g\cos\alpha}}.\]
The particle will exit at B if the time to cross the trough along its axis is an integer multiple of the oscillationâ€™s half-period. Thus, the length will be given as \footnote{There is a factor of one half added to the statement because not all the particles exit at the bottom of the gutter}
\[L = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\frac{T}{2}.\]
Thus, 
\begin{align*}
    L &= \frac{1}{2}g\sin\alpha\left(\left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\frac{T}{2}\right)^2\\
    &= \frac{1}{2}g\sin\alpha\left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)^2\frac{\pi^2 r}{g\cos\alpha}\\
    &= \boxed{\frac{\pi^2}{2}\tan\alpha\left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)^2}
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
