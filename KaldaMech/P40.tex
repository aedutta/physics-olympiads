\begin{solution}{normal}
The key difference between the barrels is that the walls in barrel provide a non-zero momentum to every small elemental mass that exits through the tap, while the other does not. Some non-zero work is done by the force exerted by these walls on the water molecules, which is not true for the other . So we first write the conservation of energy equation for the barrel: Let the small $dm$ mass of water element exit at a velocity $v_1$ from the tap of the barrel,$$\frac{1}{2} dm {v_1}^2 = dm g H$$and by impulse momentum theorem,$$F_{\text{walls}} = dm v_2 \implies (\rho g A_0 H)dt = (\rho A_0 v_2 dt) v_2$$From these two equations, we have the answers $\boxed{\sqrt{2gH}}$ and $\boxed{\sqrt{gH}}$.
