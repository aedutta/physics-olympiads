Let $f$ be the frictional force created by the floor. We then have two equations
\begin{align*}
&F-f=m\ddot x\\
&fR - F(R-a) = I \ddot\theta
\end{align*}We first find the force created by friction. Noting that the YoYo rolls without slipping. We use the relation $\ddot x = r\ddot\theta$. Substituting this into the second equation gives us
\[
fR- F(R - a) = \frac{1}{2}mR^2\frac{\ddot x}{R}\implies fR- F(R - a) = \frac{1}{2}R(m\ddot x)
\]Substituting in our first equation gives us
\[
fR - F(R - a) = \frac{1}{2}R(F -f)
\]Rearranging and simplifying gives us
\[
\frac{3}{2}fR = \frac{3}{2}FR + Fa
\]This tells us
\[
f = F + \frac{2}{3}\frac{Fa}{R}.
\]Now substituting our relation for friction into our first equation gives us
\begin{align*}
F - \left(F + \frac{2}{3}\frac{Fa}{R}\right) = m\ddot x\\
\boxed{|a|= \frac{2}{3}\frac{Fa}{mR}}
\end{align*}

By Parallel axis theorem we see that 
\[I' = I_0 + m\ell^2 \implies I' = \frac{1}{2}MR^2 + MR^2 = \frac{3}{2}MR^2\]
The torque produced by the string is given by 
\[\tau = Fa = I\alpha\implies Fa = \frac{3}{2}MR^2\left(\frac{a_r}{R}\right)\]
Simplifying gives 
\begin{align*}
Fa &= \frac{3}{2}MRa_r\\
a_r &= \boxed{\frac{2}{3}\frac{Fa}{MR}}
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
