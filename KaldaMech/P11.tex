\begin{solution}{easy}
We will use a virtual work approach.\footnote{If you are unfamiliar with virtual work, refer to the explanation in Kalda's handout, or to this \href{http://docshare04.docshare.tips/files/26737/267376365.pdf}{pdf}.} In a static situation, the net force will be zero and as a result the potential energy will be at a minimum. Any slight displacement will create no change to the potential energy in first order.

Consider what happens when the mass is lowered by a distance $dh$. The potential energy would drop by $-mg dh$. The distance between hinges would each increase by $dh/3$ to compensate for the length increase. This means the string gets stretched by $dh/3$. The energy stored thus is:$$T dh/3$$Setting these changes to zero gives:
$$-mg dh + T dh/3 = 0 \implies \boxed{T = 3mg}$$
\end{solution}
