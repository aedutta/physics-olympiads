\begin{solution}{normal}
Let the normal force on the cylinder be $N_1$, the normal force on the wedge be $N_2$, and the normal force between the cylinder and wedge be $N$. If the cylinder moves downwards with an acceleration $a_1$ and the wedge moves upwards with an acceleration $a_2$, we find from geometry that we have a constraint equation of 
\begin{align*}
Na_1\cos (180 - \alpha) + Na_2 \cos\alpha = 0\\
-a_1 + a_2 = 0 \implies a_1 = a_2
\end{align*}
To find the acceleration, we use lagrangian formalism. Let the cylinder move down by a small amount $\xi$, the wedge will then move upwards $\xi$ meaning that the change in potential energy will become
\[
\Pi(\xi) = (m - M)g\sin\alpha \xi
\]Differentiating this with respect to $\xi$ gives us
\[
\Pi'(\xi) = (m - M)g\sin\alpha.
\]The kinetic energy of the system in this case will then be given by
\[K = \frac{1}{2}(m + M)\dot\xi^2 
\]which implies that $\mathcal{M} = m + M.$ This lets the acceleration become
\[
a = \frac{m - M}{m + M}g\sin\alpha.
\] Projecting Newton's laws onto the cylinder gives us the equation
\[mg\sin\alpha - N\cos\alpha = ma\]
Substituting our value of accceleration gives us 
\[mg\sin\alpha - N\cos\alpha = m\frac{m - M}{m + M}g\sin\alpha\]
rearranging variables gives us 
\begin{align*}
mg\sin\alpha\left(1 - \frac{m -M}{m + M}\right) = N\cos\alpha\\
\boxed{N = 2\frac{Mm}{m + M}g\tan\alpha}
\end{align*}
