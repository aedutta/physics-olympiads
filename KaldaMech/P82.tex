\begin{solution}{normal}
As the water moving with a speed $v$ collides completely inelastically with the paddles moving with a speed $u$, a momentum of $dp=dm(v-u)$ is imparted to the paddles so the force on the paddle is $F=\mu(v-u)$ where in the frame of the paddle,
$$\mu=\rho S(v-u)$$The power is therefore:
$$P=Fu=\rho S(v-u)^2u$$We can maximize this by taking the derivative and set it to zero, or when:
$$3u^2-4vu+v^2=0$$This gives $u=v/3$ or $u=v$. Obviously, $u=v$ would give the minimum power so $u=v/3$ gives the maximum power to be:
$$P_\text{max}=\frac{4}{27}\rho S v^3$$Moving back to the lab frame, we have
$$\mu=\rho Sv$$or:
$$\boxed{P_\text{max}=\frac{4}{27}\mu v^2}$$
\end{solution}
