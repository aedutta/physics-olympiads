\begin{solution}{normal}
During the collision, we can conserve momentum. We have a perfectly inelastic collision where:
$$mv=(M+m)u \implies u=\frac{mv}{M+m}$$
However, since the boy continuously pushes against the other boy, the applied force will be $mg\mu$. Balancing forces, we get:
$$(m+M)a = \mu mg - \mu Mg$$
Dividing through gives the magnitude of the deceleration to be
$$a = \frac{\mu g(M - m)}{M+m}$$
Thus:
$$d=\frac{v^2}{2a}=\frac{\left(\frac{mv}{M+m}\right)^2}{2\frac{(M-m)\mu g}{M+m}}=\boxed{\frac{m^2v^2}{2(M^2-m^2)\mu g}}$$
\end{solution}
