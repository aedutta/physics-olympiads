\begin{solution}{normal}
 Clearly the angular momentum is conserved about any point lying on the line passing through the rod. For convenience, let us choose the point where the collision occurs: $$M v \frac{\ell}{2} \ \hat{k} - \frac{M{\ell}^2}{12} \omega \ \hat{k} = 0 \Rightarrow \vec{\omega} = -\frac{6v}{\ell} \hat{k}$$ By momentum conservation, we have $$M v = m v_f \Rightarrow v_f = \frac{M}{m} v$$ where $v_f$ is the final velocity of the puck. Since the collision is elastic, $$ e = 1 = \frac{(v_f)-0}{(v+ \frac{\omega \ell}{2}) - 0} \Rightarrow v_f = v+\frac{\omega \ell}{2}$$ From these three equations, we obtain $$\frac{M}{m} = 4$$

Instead of using the equation of the restitution coefficient, we use energy conservation. $$\frac{1}{2} Mv^2 + \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{M{\ell}^2}{12}\right) \omega^2 = \frac{1}{2}m{v_f}^2$$ Solving this equation with the equation for linear and angular momentum conservation yields the same answer.
