\begin{solution}{normal}
The rod will act like a spring (since the rod is thin and made out of steel, while steel is elastic). After the left sphere has collided with the stationary sphere, the latter will acquire velocity $v_0$ and the former will stay at rest. Using momentum conservation when considering the entire system at impact, we find that,
\[(2m)v_0 = mv_0 + (2m)v_f\implies v_f = \frac{1}{2}v_0.\]
We can then compare the initial and final kinetic energies
\begin{align*}
K_i&= \frac{1}{2}(2m)v_0^2 = mv_0^2\\
K_f&= \frac{1}{2}(2m)v_f^2 + \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 = \frac{3}{4}mv_0^2
\end{align*}
Here, we can see that kinetic energy is not conserved. However, we still do not know where this energy goes to. The dumbbell, as a system of spheres and springs, will begin oscillating around its centre of mass. After a half period the dumbbell will be too far away to expand outwards and hit the mass again. Thus, we can say that the rest of the energy is stored in the oscillating dumbbell after.
