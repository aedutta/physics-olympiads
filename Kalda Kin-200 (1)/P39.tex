\begin{solution}{normal}
At that moment, the acceleration of the dog is equal to
$$\vec{a} = \frac{d{\vec{v_2}}}{dt} = v_2\frac{ d\theta}{dt} \hat{r}$$

By Idea 37, we have the angular velocity of the relative position vector as 
$$\frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{v_1\sin{90^\circ}}{\ell} = \frac{v_1}{\ell}$$

Hence, from the two relations, the acceleration of the dog is
$$a = \boxed{\frac{v_1 v_2}{\ell}}$$
\end{solution}
