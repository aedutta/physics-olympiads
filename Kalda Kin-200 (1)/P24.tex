As the wheel is rolling, we have that $\omega = \dfrac{v}{R}$.\vspace{3mm}

The speed of the highest point in the lab frame is $$v + \omega R = 2v$$

Therefore, we find that the centripetal force at the highest point is $$a_c = \frac{(2v)^2}{r}$$

The speed of highest point in frame of wheelâ€™s centre is $\omega R = v$. \vspace{3mm}

Therefore, the centripetal force in the wheels center is $$a_c = \omega^2 R = \frac{v^2}{R}$$

As both frames are inertial frames, 
\[\frac {v^2}{R} = \frac {4v^2}{r}\implies \boxed{r = 4R}\]
