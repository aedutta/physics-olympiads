\begin{solution}{easy}
Using Idea 11, we have:
$$T^\gamma \propto P^{\gamma-1}$$
Therefore, a slight change in temperature would imply:
$$\gamma\left(\frac{\delta T}{T}\right) = (\gamma-1)\left(\frac{\delta P}{P}\right)$$
The crux of this problem is that the pressure change is so small thus by idea 13, it can be approximated with $\Delta p=-\rho gh$. Therefore, we can isolate for $\delta T$ to be:
$$\delta T =\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}\left(\frac{-\rho_0 gH_0}{P_0}\right)T_0$$
