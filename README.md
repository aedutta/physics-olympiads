# PhysOly
These are the source files on materials for physics olympiad preparation. You can read more about them [on our website](https://physoly.tech/).

## Compilation
The code can be compiled by using ``LaTeX`` and ``olympiad.asy``. You can download the package [here](https://math.berkeley.edu/~monks/images/olympiad.asy) while ``LaTeX`` can be run online through websites like overleaf. 
The purpose of this repository is to correct any mistakes found in these TeX files. *Pull requests are welcome* and corrections can also be emailed. 

## Pull Requests
